# Temporary!

This is here only to serve up copies of a Github [Gist][Gist] by [@witoldsz][witoldsz]
through [Bower][Bower], since there is not another simple means for redistribution.

The hope is that the original author will continue his work and make it
available thruogh Bower himself.

As soon as that happens, this will disappear.

For now, use in `component.json` like this

```javascript
{
  "name": "ClientSide Dependencies",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "angular-auth": "git+https://github.com/Iristyle/bower-angularAuth.git#0.0.1"
  }
}
```
